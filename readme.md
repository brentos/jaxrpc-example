##JAX-RPC Example for JBossWS

Project is based on JBossWS community documentation:

<https://community.jboss.org/wiki/JBossWS-JAX-RPCUserGuide#jive_content_id_Document_Style_Endpoints>

This project shows how to build a JAX-RPC project for deployment in EAP 6.  This
will use a **document/literal/wrapped** WSDL.

JAX-RPC requires a couple of deployment descriptors to be present:

- `webservices.xml`
- `jaxrpc-mapping.xml`

These are generated by WSTools, in addition to the WSDL and a few Java stub
classes.  All generated classes have been committed to the project, though
there is a `generateStubs.sh` script present that can be used to regenerate
these files.  Note that *you must use EAP 5* to generate these files because
`wstools.sh` is not packaged in EAP6.
