##JAX-RPC Example for JBossWS

Project is based on JBossWS community documentation:

<https://community.jboss.org/wiki/JBossWS-JAX-RPCUserGuide#jive_content_id_Document_Style_Endpoints>

This project shows how to build a JAX-RPC project for deployment in EAP 6.  This
will use a **document/literal/wrapped** WSDL.

JAX-RPC requires a couple of deployment descriptors to be present:

- `webservices.xml`
- `jaxrpc-mapping.xml`

These are generated by WSTools, in addition to the WSDL and a few Java stub
classes.  All generated classes have been committed to the project, though
there is a `generateStubs.sh` script present that can be used to regenerate
these files.  Note that *you must use EAP 5* to generate these files because
`wstools.sh` is not packaged in EAP6.

To deploy the project (after the generated files are in place), simply run `mvn
jboss-as:deploy` or copy the .war to `JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments`.  The
service can be tested by executing `request.sh`, which is simply a `curl`
command to send the SOAP XML found in `request.xml`.

Upon deployment, you should see something like this in your logs:

```
15:33:53,029 INFO  [org.jboss.as.server.deployment] (MSC service thread 1-2) JBAS015876: Starting deployment of "jaxrpc-example.war" (runtime-name: "jaxrpc-example.war")
15:33:53,379 INFO  [org.jboss.ws.native] (MSC service thread 1-8) JBWS025010: WSDL published to: file:/home/remote/klape/jboss/product-distributions/standalone/data/wsdl/jaxrpc-example.war/HelloWorld.wsdl
15:33:53,389 INFO  [org.jboss.as.webservices] (MSC service thread 1-5) JBAS015539: Starting service jboss.ws.port-component-link
15:33:53,400 INFO  [org.jboss.as.webservices] (MSC service thread 1-4) JBAS015539: Starting service jboss.ws.endpoint."jaxrpc-example.war".HelloEndpoint
15:33:53,431 INFO  [org.jboss.web] (ServerService Thread Pool -- 52) JBAS018210: Register web context: /jaxrpc-example
15:33:53,549 INFO  [org.jboss.as.server] (management-handler-thread - 2) JBAS018559: Deployed "jaxrpc-example.war" (runtime-name : "jaxrpc-example.war")
```

And you should see something like this as an XML response (after running it through `xmllint`):

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<env:Envelope xmlns:env="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
  <env:Header/>
  <env:Body>
    <ns1:sayHelloResponse xmlns:ns1="http://jaxrpc.gss.redhat.com/types" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
      <result>Hello, Kyle!</result>
    </ns1:sayHelloResponse>
  </env:Body>
</env:Envelope>
```
